# CatClicker

This project is a course from Udacity that I am doing for my Nano Degree.

## Project Requirements for Cat Clicker

##Visuals
The application should display a picture of a cat and a number of clicks.
The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

##Interaction
The number of clicks should increment when the cat picture is clicked.

##Inspiration
This project was inspired by the facebook sensation Cow Clicker and inspired by the 
popularity of Cat Images on the internet.

##Updating to Part Code
going to update this project for the next project in Udacity, using this concept.
